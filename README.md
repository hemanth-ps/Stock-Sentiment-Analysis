## Stock-Sentiment-Analysis
### The Objective is to find whether the stock price is increasing or decreasing based on the text headlines on a given day.
### We have 2 output labels 0 and 1.where 0 is for decrease in stockprice  and 1 is for increase in stock price.
### I have Cleaned the data and made into a corpus and vectorized the data using Bag of Words and also TfIdf Vectorizer and trained both the vectors.
### Both are giving almost same results.And precision for label 0 is good with TfIdf vector a good thing to notice.95 times it is classifying correctly when the stock price is decreasing.
